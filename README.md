# Suru Homes - Real Estate new website design

### Redesign for the company's website that's too dated.

The website needs to be updated with new design trends to support their branding strategy.

To view what is done so far, go into the `vanilla` folder and run `npm run dev`.

The `vanilla` folder doesn't contain any app framework, e.g React, Angular, etc. It's just vanilla code created with `vite`. However, it's using `tailwindcss` for styling.
